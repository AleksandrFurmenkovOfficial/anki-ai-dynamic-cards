# Anki AI Dynamic Cards Add-on

Have you ever noticed how frustrating it is when learning a new word or phrase, you don't have access to an endless supply of real-life examples? This plugin solves that problem using AI! Each time, you will see new and relevant examples for the words and phrases you are studying. Currently, this plugin only supports English and simple cards either without formatting or with minimal formatting, where the word or phrase being studied is highlighted using <b> tags.

Anki AI Dynamic Cards is an add-on for Anki that dynamically generates example sentences related to the *english* words you are learning, using the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT. This add-on provides a unique way to improve the effectiveness of memorizing new words and their usage in context, giving users the ability to practice real-world scenarios. These generated examples don't stored in database.

!! This is a beta concept release.
